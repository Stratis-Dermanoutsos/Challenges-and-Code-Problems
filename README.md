# Challenges-and-Code-Problems

 - This repository contains / will contain small and quick coding challenges as a means of practice.
 - The challenges' descriptions will be written in their respective folder along with my implementation of the solution.
 - For the implementations, I mostly use C# but any language is an option as long as it is required in the challenge's description or I am willing to use it for a particular challenge.
